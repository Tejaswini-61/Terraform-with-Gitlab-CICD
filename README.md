# Automating AWS Deployment Using Terraform with GitLab CI/CD

This project demonstrates how to automate AWS infrastructure deployment using **Terraform** and a **GitLab CI/CD pipeline**. The goal is to eliminate manual setup steps and ensure consistent, version-controlled infrastructure delivery.

---

## Overview

The automation works by combining Terraform’s infrastructure-as-code capabilities with GitLab’s CI/CD pipelines. Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline validates the Terraform configuration, generates a plan of proposed changes, and applies those changes to AWS if approved.

---

## How It Works

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   All AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets) are defined in Terraform configuration files stored in the repository. This ensures that the infrastructure setup is consistent, reproducible, and trackable.

2. **GitLab CI/CD Integration**
   The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines automated pipeline stages such as `validate`, `plan`, and `apply`.

   * **Validate:** Checks the syntax and structure of Terraform files.
   * **Plan:** Generates a detailed report of the infrastructure changes Terraform intends to make.
   * **Apply:** Deploys or updates the AWS infrastructure automatically or after manual approval.

3. **Pipeline Execution**
   When code changes are pushed to the main branch or a merge request is created, the pipeline triggers automatically. The stages run sequentially to verify, preview, and apply infrastructure updates.

4. **Environment Variables**
   AWS credentials and region information are securely stored as GitLab CI/CD variables. Terraform uses these during pipeline execution to authenticate and interact with AWS services.

5. **Terraform Backend (Optional)**
   For production-grade setups, Terraform state can be stored in an AWS S3 bucket with DynamoDB for state locking. This prevents concurrent changes and ensures that infrastructure state remains consistent across deployments.

6. **Manual Approval Step**
   To maintain control over production changes, the `apply` stage is configured for manual execution. This allows teams to review the Terraform plan before applying it.

## Benefits

* **Automated Deployment:** Eliminates manual AWS setup steps.
* **Consistency:** All environments are built from the same codebase.
* **Version Control:** Changes are tracked and auditable through Git.
* **Security:** AWS credentials are stored securely in GitLab variables.
* **Scalability:** Easily extendable for multi-environment or multi-account AWS setups.

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and add your Terraform configuration files.
2. Configure AWS credentials and region in GitLab CI/CD variables.
3. Push code to the repository — the pipeline will automatically run.
4. Review the plan output and manually trigger the apply stage if required.

---

## Best Practices

* Use an **S3 backend** and **DynamoDB locking** for Terraform state management.
* Enable **branch protection** and **merge request approvals** before applying changes.
* Regularly update Terraform versions and modules.
* Monitor AWS resources to ensure compliance with cost and security policies.

## Summary

By integrating Terraform with GitLab CI/CD, this setup delivers a fully automated, secure, and reliable method to deploy and manage AWS infrastructure. It aligns infrastructure changes with DevOps workflows, improving speed, repeatability, and operational control.
